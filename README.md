# Rails examples for koyo-postgres-replication gem

例   rei  - Japanese for `example`
効用 koyo - Japanese for `utility`

This has branches for different versions of Rails using the
koyo-postgres-replication gem. Main documentation on this gem is at
[https://github.com/wiseleyb/koyo-postgres-replication](https://github.com/wiseleyb/koyo-postgres-replication)

Example projects include Docker files to allow you to play with this stuff
without trashing your main system setup (for example, running Rails 4 and Rails
7 on the same box is tricky at best)

Rails version branches:

* [Rails 7](https://github.com/wiseleyb/rei-postgres-replication/tree/rails-7-example)
* Rails 6: coming soon
* Rails 5: coming soon
* Rails 4: coming soon
